## About the Project

Cybersecurity incident reporting is often centralized, risking censorship, tampering, and privacy breaches. Organizations are hesitant to share threat intelligence due to confidentiality concerns. **AuricDefence** solves this problem by:

‚úÖ Providing decentralized, immutable evidence storage on blockchain.  
‚úÖ Allowing anonymous reporting via Decentralized Identities (DID) and zk-SNARKs.  
‚úÖ Enabling privacy-compliant threat intelligence sharing.  
‚úÖ Offering user control over personal data in compliance with GDPR.

## Features

- **Decentralized Incident Reporting**  
  Anonymous reporting with DID and zk-SNARKs ensures privacy and security.

- **Immutable Storage**  
  Blockchain ledger records incident metadata and evidence hashes permanently.

- **Incident Tracking**  
  Smart contracts and event listeners track investigation progress.

- **Threat Intelligence Sharing**  
  Asymmetric cryptography enables secure sharing of intelligence between verified nodes.

- **User Data Management**  
  Portal for users to view, download, or delete their personal data.

- **Expert Assistance**  
  Secure chat/helpdesk connects users with cybersecurity professionals 24/7.

## Architecture

**Backend:**
- Python Flask for API development and WebSockets.
- Web3.py for blockchain integration.
- Cryptography libraries for encryption.
- IPFS API for decentralized storage.

**Frontend:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for responsive UI.
- ethers.js and web3.js for blockchain interactions.

**Blockchain:**
- Ethereum (Solidity smart contracts) or Hyperledger Fabric.
- zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving proofs.
- IPFS for decentralized file storage.

**Cybersecurity:**
- Security monitoring with PyOD for anomaly detection.
- Log analysis via Elasticsearch.
- Celery tasks for incident response workflows.
- Compliance checks for GDPR and other regulations.

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL for structured off-chain data.

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 for non-anonymous users.
- Decentralized Identity (DID) for anonymous users.
- JWT for session management.

**Deployment:**
- Docker containers.
- Kubernetes orchestration.
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

## Setup & Installation

> **Prerequisites:**
> - Python 3.9+
> - Node.js & npm
> - Docker
> - Ganache or testnet for blockchain testing

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/auricdefence.git
    cd auricdefence
    ```
2.üêç Backend Setup (Python + Flask)
Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python -m venv backend
source backend/bin/activate       # For Linux/macOS
backend\Scripts\activate          # For Windows

```
3.Install required Python libraries
```
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_bcrypt email-validator web3 cryptography ipfshttpclient pyjwt
```
4.Run the Flask server
```
python app.py
```
Ensure app.py contains your Flask app and is correctly configured with routes and blockchain logic.
